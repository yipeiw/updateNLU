Building_or_Public_Space driving around okay do VBG IN NN VBP copilot copilot driver driver
Road_or_Driveway or right gon na CC RB RB VBP driver driver copilot
Person_or_Vehicle no right think the DT NN VBP DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space the roadways we just DT NNS PRP RB copilot copilot copilot copilot
Other careful because quite a JJ IN RB DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway and at we want CC IN PRP VBP copilot copilot copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway there at yeah it 's EX IN NN PRP VBZ driver driver copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway intersection yeah not an NN NN RB DT driver copilot copilot copilot
Person_or_Vehicle an intersection yeah think DT NN VBP VBP copilot copilot driver copilot
Road_or_Driveway 's it just just VBZ PRP RB RB driver copilot driver
Road_or_Driveway a li- a driveway DT NN DT NN copilot driver copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway yeah think it 's NN VBP PRP VBZ driver copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway continue straight continue straight NN VBD VBP RB driver driver copilot copilot
Traffic_Signal up until okay and IN IN NN CC copilot copilot driver copilot
Building_or_Public_Space right into okay okay RB IN NN NN copilot copilot driver driver
Building_or_Public_Space so these here yes IN DT RB VBZ driver driver driver copilot
Person_or_Vehicle okay so stop pull NN IN VBP JJ driver driver driver copilot
Road_or_Driveway pull up and Phil NN IN CC NNP copilot copilot copilot copilot
Person_or_Vehicle here and can jump RB CC MD VB copilot copilot copilot copilot
Person_or_Vehicle okay thank Phil see NN VBD NNP VBP driver driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle thank you see you NN PRP NN PRP driver driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle Phil see later and NNP VBP RBR CC driver driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle and so I need CC RB PRP VBP driver driver driver driver
Other so Ian need to IN NNP VBP TO driver driver driver driver
Building_or_Public_Space get to okay how NN TO VBP WRB driver driver copilot driver
Person_or_Vehicle how do get there WRB VBP VB RB driver driver driver driver
Building_or_Public_Space I get from here PRP VBP IN RB driver driver driver driver
Building_or_Public_Space there from Crown Start-Up EX IN NNP NNP driver driver copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space from here is on IN RB VBZ IN driver driver copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space side of okay so NN IN NN IN copilot copilot driver copilot
Road_or_Driveway and take to the CC VB TO DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space side of it 's NN IN PRP VBZ copilot copilot driver
Person_or_Vehicle 's it interesting call car VBZ PRP JJ VBP NN driver driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle expressways yes think it 's NNS VBZ VBP PRP VBZ driver copilot driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle exactly so a European RB RB DT JJ copilot driver copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway ohh to the left NN TO DT NN driver driver driver driver
Road_or_Driveway the left yes okay DT VBN VBZ NN driver driver copilot driver
Person_or_Vehicle okay so think that NN IN VBP IN driver copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space to restore in fact TO VB IN NN copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space has used for the VBZ VBN IN DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space apparently because carcinogen and RB IN VBN CC copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space restore wheels so we 'll IN NNS RB PRP MD copilot driver copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway turn left okay so NN VBD NN IN copilot copilot driver copilot
Person_or_Vehicle wheels the guess old NNS DT VBP JJ driver copilot driver copilot
Road_or_Driveway limit in is thirty NN IN VBZ NN copilot copilot copilot copilot
Person_or_Vehicle five okay guess it CD NN VBP PRP copilot driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle that way mean the DT NN VBP DT driver driver driver driver
Person_or_Vehicle and so just heard CC RB RB VBP driver copilot copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway turn left and we 'll NN VBD CC PRP MD copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space okay to okay so NN TO VBP RB driver copilot copilot copilot
Traffic_Signal up to at the IN TO IN DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Road_or_Driveway end of and we NN IN CC PRP copilot copilot copilot copilot
Person_or_Vehicle right if remember this RB IN VBP DT copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space 's McDonald no it 's VBZ NNP DT PRP VBZ driver copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space back past the McDonald 's RB JJ DT NNP POS copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space okay so is actually NN IN VBZ RB copilot copilot copilot copilot
Building_or_Public_Space back towards okay so RB NNS NN RB copilot copilot driver copilot
Road_or_Driveway turn right and continue NN RB CC VB copilot copilot copilot copilot
